		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<h3>Register</h3>
		<p>
			To register you provide your chosen user name (first come, first served) and your email address.  The EMlogin checkbox is for the yet to be released login app.  An email will be sent to your address with a link to login with.
		</p>
		<h3>Log In</h3>
		<p>
			If you have previously registered, enter your user name in the text box provided and click on the Login button.  An email will be sent to the address you registered with with a link to login with.
		</p>  
		<p>
			You may then:
			<ul>
				<li>see the papers previously entered</li>
				<li>enter (and edit) your own papers</li>
				<li>vote for papers</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			If you click on Guest, you may see the papers, but not be able to: 
			<ul>
				<li>add new ones</li>
				<li>edit any papers you may have previously entered under your user name</li>
				<li>vote</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Papers</h3>

		<p>
			Papers consist of: Titles (also a link), Comments (or Abstracts), and References (links and texts).
		</p>
		<p>
			Clicking on the Add paper button will take you to a form for entering these components.  Click Save when you have finished entering your components.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Display</h3>

		<p>
			The main page displays the papers in the order the user selects by using the radio buttons at the top of the page.
		</p>
		<p>
			For papers the user has entered there is an Edit button and a Close button.  The Edit button takes you to a page like the Add page, but with the current values filled in, so you can edit them.  The Close button effectively removes the paper from the program. 
		</p>
		
		<h3>Voting</h3>
		<p>
			By default each user has 15 votes to allocate amongst the papers, with a maximum of 5 votes for a single paper.  The papers can then be sorted by the sum of votes.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are + and - buttons adjacent to the paper display for users to adjust their votes.
