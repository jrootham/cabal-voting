			This is a program designed to help chose academic papers to be read by The Cabal Friday Night Reading Group.
		</p>

		<p>
			Papers are expected to be freely available on the web.  
		</p>

		<p>
			Papers are ranked with an approval voting system.
		</p>

		<p>
			The current limits are: users can add 5 papers, they have 15 votes to distribute, and can vote for a paper up to 5 times.  An administrator may adjust these limits.
